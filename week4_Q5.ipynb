    "- First, the length of the array is checked. If the length is less than $3$, the length of the array itself is returned as the longest convex subsequence length.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The algorithm initializes the longest convex subsequence length to $2$, as a convex subsequence requires at least three elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Next, the algorithm iterates through each element in the array as the potential starting point of a convex subsequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each starting element at index $i$, the algorithm initializes the current convex subsequence length to $2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The algorithm then checks all subsequent elements from index $i+2$ to the end of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each subsequent element at index $j$, the algorithm compares the difference between `arr[j] - arr[j-1]` with the previous difference arr`[j-1] - arr[j-2]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the current difference `arr[j] - arr[j-1]` is greater than the previous difference `arr[j-1] - arr[j-2]`, it satisfies the convex condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In such cases, the algorithm increments the length of the convex subsequence by $1$ and updates the previous difference to the current difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After checking all subsequent elements for convexity, the algorithm keeps track of the maximum length of the convex subsequence encountered so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, the algorithm returns the maximum length of the convex subsequence as the result.\n",
