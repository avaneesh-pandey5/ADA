    "The `prims_algorithm` function takes the graph as input and returns the `minimum spanning tree`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It starts from an arbitrary node (here, the first node in the graph) and adds it to the visited set.\n",
    "\n",
    "It maintains a `min-heap` called `min_heap` to keep track of the edges with the minimum weight that cross the visited and unvisited nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, all the edges from the start node are added to the `min-heap`.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the `min-heap` is not empty, the algorithm selects the edge with the minimum weight from the `min-heap`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the destination node of the selected edge is not visited, it is added to the visited set, and the edge is added to the `minimum spanning tree.`\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, all the edges from the newly visited node are added to the `min-heap`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process continues until all nodes are visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the minimum spanning tree is returned and printed."
