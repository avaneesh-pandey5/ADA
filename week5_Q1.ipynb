    "- The variable length represents the current length of the chain being considered, and $i$ and $j$ represent the starting and ending indices of the chain, respectively.\n",

    "- It then iterates over all possible splits of the chain, represented by the variable $k$, and computes the number of multiplications for the current split.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of multiplications is calculated using the formula: \\\n",
    "$ dp[i][k]  + dp[k + 1][j] + dimensions[i] * dimensions[k + 1] * dimensions[j + 1]$. \\\n",
    "This formula represents the number of multiplications required to multiply the matrices from A[i] to A[k] and from A[k+1] to A[j], along with the multiplication of the resulting matrices.\n",

    "- The algorithm updates the minimum number of multiplications for the current chain length using \\\n",
    "$dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], multiplications)$.\n",
