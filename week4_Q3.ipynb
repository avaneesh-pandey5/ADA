    "- Compare the element at index i with the element at index j.\n",
    "- If the element at index i is greater than the element at index $j$, it means we can include `arr[i]` in a longer increasing alternating subsequence. Update the length at index $i$ in inc_lengths as the maximum value between its current length at index i and the length at index j in dec_lengths plus one.\n",
    "- If the element at index $i$ is smaller than the element at index $j$, it means we can include `arr[i]` in a longer decreasing alternating subsequence. Update the length at index $i$ in dec_lengths as the maximum value between its current length at index i and the length at index j in inc_lengths plus one.\n",
